---
I'm a London based software developer, passionate about building and improving the web.  

You can see some of the code I've written [on github](http://github.com/tomafro) and some of my [contributions to rails here](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/tom-ward/commits).

I'm a member of [FreeRange](http://gofreerange.com), a collective of talented, like-minded developers.  If you're interested on having us work on a project with you, get in touch at [lets@gofreerange.com](mailto:lets@gofreerange.com). 

<h2 style="padding-top:2em;">About tomafro.net</h2>
This site is built using [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), the 'blog-aware, static site generator'.  The theme was custom written from the ground up, and date archives and tag pages are generated using a rake task.  The full source is available [here in github](http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro.net/tree/master).
