<p>What is C4MVC? &nbsp;Well per the about us page it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our Vision is to share knowledge and best practices around using the framework, as well as encourage community contributions that serve the greater good.</p>
<p>Through interactive sessions, projects, and aggregated blog feeds we hope to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way for new developers to use the framework the right way.</li>
<li>Techniques and tools to allow experienced developers to develop with less friction.</li>
<li>A self supporting community.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Per my definition:</p>
<blockquote><p>A virtual user group on&nbsp;Wednesday mornings&nbsp;where I can listen in on the Asp.Net MVC big guns discuss the topic of the framework that I need to learn better.</p></blockquote>

Besides the great free content such as last weeks<a href="http://www.c4mvc.net/Home/Events" target="_blank"> Advanced MVC2</a> topic sometimes, just sometimes, you can win some stuff. &nbsp;In my case, I loves me some 30 day subscription to <a href="http://www.tekpub.com/" target="_blank">TekPub</a> which also happens to have a lengthy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tekpub.com/preview/aspmvc" target="_blank">Asp.NET MVC series</a>. Now the only problem I have is finding the correct window to pull the pin this content grenade so that I can put together 30 days of <s>face melting&nbsp;guitar&nbsp;solo</s> mind&nbsp;melding&nbsp;content&nbsp;assimilation. &nbsp;Parent of 3 (4 and under) makes that a <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php" target="_blank">GTD</a> challenge.</p>
<p>The C4MVC.NET (google) group is open to anyone to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/c4mvc" target="_blank">join</a> so come and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/c4mvc" target="_blank">join</a> the group to get some good nuggets of Asp.net MVC knowledge on! &nbsp;No really, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/c4mvc" target="_blank">join now</a>!</p>
