<p>I've been in these situations too many times where I've had to receive a logical document and the "text" has been split across multiple items in a list.  Most of the time it occurs with databases but I've had to do the same thing with B2B integrations with Xml too.</p>
<p>Before Linq I'd end up with the prototypical <em>foreach</em> code but this last time I need to (re)solve such a problem Linq had since been born.</p>

<p>I do realized that ORM and other database queries have the ability to do these aggregates for you.  I was merely trying to point out some Linq tricks for those situations where you are dealing with objects and might not be in a data access situation.</p>
