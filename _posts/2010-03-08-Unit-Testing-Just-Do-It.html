<p>I used to be the ConsoleApplication132 type of developer and no big surprise my projects didn't have any unit tests in them, if any at all.&nbsp; To try and remedy this I took a 3 week TestProject1 challenge.&nbsp; Instead of doing quick spikes to a .NET console application to 'try something out' I spun up a Test Project.</p>
